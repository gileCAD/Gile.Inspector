# Gile.Inspector
Inspection tool for AutoCAD Database (.NET).
This tool is inspired by MgdDbg from ADB-DevTech (https://github.com/ADN-DevTech/MgdDbg). It is a sort of "lightweight" version which only provides the Database and entities inspection.
It is strongly base on Reflexion so that it should be less AutoCAD versions dependent.
Building the solution in Release mode will update the "Gile.Inspector.bundle" folder which is ready to be deployed in the "%appdata%\Autodesk\ApplicationPlugins" directory.
